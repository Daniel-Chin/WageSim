Questions:
    Instead of gradient descend, can I try "trading": 
        Increase the price when there is shortage
        Decrease the price when there is surplus? 
        (Kinda treating the Excess Demand vector as the gradient for p)

Things to think:
    Is there a way to avoid Walras's Law? 
    Does pure supply of labor break Walras's law? 
    How to visualize? Think animation. 
    When population is constant:
        at the beginning, capital is low, processes that are labor-intensive grow. 
        Later, Capital accumulates, and the population constraint becomes prominant, so the world now favors capital-intensive processes. 
        Visualize! capital-intensiveness score, labor score

Notes
    Each process produces one thing, take all things, and require some capital goods. 
    Capital good can be modelled as B_j = A_j * (1-depreciation)

Visuals:
    Process intensity
    Price
    Population
    Wages
    Unemployment
    GDP (price * production)
    Job Distribution
