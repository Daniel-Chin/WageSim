Questions:
    Instead of gradient descend, can I try "trading": 
        Increase the price when there is shortage
        Decrease the price when there is surplus? 
        (Kinda treating the Excess Demand vector as the gradient for p)

Things to think:
    Is there a way to avoid Walras's Law? 
    Does pure supply of labor break Walras's law? 
    How to visualize? Think animation. 

Notes
    Capital good can be modelled as A_j = B_j * (1+depreciation)
