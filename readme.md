# Von Neumann Econ + Wages
Daniel Chin

## Project Idea
Use the Von Neumann economy model and include capital goods, natural resources, and labor.  
* Capital goods: sustains and depreciates. Sets the upper bound of the scale of a process.  
* Natural resources: some goods has a production upper bound. (Coal may be easier to get, but limited. Solar energy is harder to get, but modeled as unlimited.)  
* Labor: Price of labor is wages. Supply of labor is proportional to the population size.  
* Population: We can explore different models. Static population, exponential growth, growth according to welfare level, family planning...  

## Investigation
What happens to wages when...  
* the economy grows?  
* AI replaces human labor?  
* Thanos kills half of the population?  
* contraception technology breakthrough?  
* natural resources go out?  

We can further have multiple categories of labor: untrained, farming, handcraft, programming...  
And then investigate: what happens to the different groups of people when we introduce a better process to produce something that requires less human labor? (Similar to when a foreign economy export a large quantity of such good to the home economy.)
